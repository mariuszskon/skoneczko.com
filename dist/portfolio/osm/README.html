It is a web interface that manages the dates of purchases along with their other details and helps find orders which were not delivered by the expected date, saving time and money.</p><p>The logic of the utility is written from scratch in the PHP programming language. To ensure an attractive layout, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> along with its dependency javascript libraries <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Popper.js</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> were used on the front-end. Icons were sourced from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>. All of these libraries are published under a permissive license which allows their free use in other projects.</p><p>By default, the software should be installed as follows:</p><ol><li>Copy the "public" directory to where the web server expects public files, renaming it if necessary.</li><li>Copy the accompanying "osm-modules" directory to the same directory as the "public" one - <strong>not</strong> inside it!</li><li>Verify that the server has appropriate permissions to read itself, and write to a text file "osm_db.txt" in the same directory as the "public" and "osm_modules" directory.</li></ol></body></html>
