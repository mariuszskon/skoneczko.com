<p>Recently I was working on a JavaScript cryptography toolkit as a side-project. The result is <a href="https://github.com/mariuszskon/crypto-toolkit">crypto-toolkit</a>. Obviously, don't use it in serious operations because it is probably full of flaws that a hobbyist "cryptographer" like me wouldn't notice. But it is a fun tool nevertheless. The <a href="https://github.com/mariuszskon/crypto-toolkit">source code</a> is licensed under the MIT license and you can imediately use the tool online <a href="http://mariuszskon.github.io/crypto-toolkit">right now</a>.</p>
