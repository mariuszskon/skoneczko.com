                    <img class="left" src="/img/rtsaustralia-bystro.png" alt="Screenshot of Bystro, showing an online form to fill in regarding translaton details">
                    <p>To optimise the business process of exchanging translation details for <a href="https://www.rtsaustralia.com.au">Russian Translation Services Australia</a>, I created <a href="https://www.rtsaustralia.com.au/translate">Bystro</a> - a sophisticated online form which handles a range of common documents automatically. The customer is taken through a series of streamlined steps optimised for their document type, in order to let the translator know about preferred translations of subjective components like given names. Furthermore, payment is collected directly online. This significantly reduces the burden on translators, who do not need to contact the client directly to confirm the preferred translation or to ask for payment. Finally, the system generates consistent PDF files once the translator has completed their work, meaning there is no more copy-paste into chaotic templates.</p>

                    <img class="left" src="/img/chipbox.png" alt="chipbox screenshot">
                    <p>My biggest low-level project to date, <a href="https://github.com/mariuszskon/chipbox/">chipbox</a> is a cross-platform CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter written in Standard C and utilising the SDL2 library. Although its games are humble, this program has given me a greater appreciation for low level and especially emulator development. By using test-driven development (TDD), compatibility with existing CHIP-8 software was excellent as soon as all opcodes were implemented.</p>

                    <p>A collection of cryptographic ciphers and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Don't use them in serious projects though, because I'm not a professional cryptographer, and they don't really follow strict standards. <a href="https://mariuszskon.github.io/crypto-toolkit">Try it out</a>.</p>
